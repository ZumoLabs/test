===========================

Zumo Labs is committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other traits or characteristics.

* The use of inappropriate images, including in a community member's avatar
* The use of inappropriate language, including in a community member's nickname
* Any spamming, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks

Our Goal
------------

The goal of this document is to set the overall tone for our community. This isn’t an exhaustive list of things you can and can't do. Rather, take this document in the spirit in which it’s intended, and try to be your best self.



We value many things beyond technical expertise, including collaboration and supporting others within our community. Providing a positive experience for other community members can have a much more significant impact than simply providing the correct answer.



Scope
------------

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by Zumo Labs. This includes, but is not limited to, the Discord server, our repositories on GitHub, the YouTube-channel, and meet-ups. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.



The ZPY Code of Conduct applies equally to all members of the community, including staff.
